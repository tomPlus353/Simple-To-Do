# Simple-To-Do

-Barebones task list

-List of tuples of tasks with start time

-Takes in list with start time.

-When task is done it is written into the text file with the total time taken.

# Task Timer

-takes in a task tuple and user sets a time for themselves to complete said task.

# Daily To-Do
-4 persistant data types: 

->Uncompleted tasks(saved whenever the user wants to take a break)

->Daily tasks(can be refreshed by the user, so they don't need to type up common tasks)

->Tomorrow List(So that the user can plan out their day ahead of time)

->Deadlines(AKA long term tasks. User can add tasks to this list to work on later, or if they want to be reminded of a task in the future.) - Not a replacement for your calendar.
